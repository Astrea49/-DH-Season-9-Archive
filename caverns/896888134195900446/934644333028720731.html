Why? Because she had basically made the caverns her home since she can’t really leave. So, she mostly just existed within the space of the caverns. She was lucky in the sense it was a larger cavern</em> (or I’m at least assuming the crystalline caverns are large) <em>so at least she wouldn’t have to deal with a small space. Her day was mostly the same with aimlessly wandering the caverns, just passing time in any way she really could. She was floating about, since that was something she was still figuring it out. In all honesty, she was still getting used to the floatiness, although she was choosing to hover around more than when she first appeared in the crystalline caverns.</em> <em>However, the aimless wandering had come to a close as the other wandered in towards the pond. The pond seemed to be a common point for where most would sit, or at least that is where most of Erina’s conversations have been. Probably because of how peaceful the surroundings of the pond were. Hopefully Akuza didn’t mind a ghost dropping in to say hello. She approached the pond area, and tried to land back on the ground after hovering around. However, luck appeared to not be on her side. Erina tried to land on her feet, however, she ended up stumbling and falling over, only showing how much of an Amatuer she was with the whole ghost ordeal. If she was still alive, there would’ve been a very loud thud. However, assuming since she is a ghost there wouldn’t have been the noise of the fall, the most there would’ve been was just an “oof moment” from the geologist. She quickly got back onto her feet after the fall, and tried to straighten her glasses again.

However, the reality of the fact that not every topic of conversation is science always looked over her. So, she often took the time to listen to others rather than start the conversation herself. Although she was still not the best at picking up social cues, she did at least take notice of how Akuza quickly swapped the topic. Although, how much of that topic could’ve really been elaborated on? Probably not much, seeing as how not much was mentioned. She nodded in agreement with the topic of how boring it must’ve been in the caverns.</em> “It is more lonely, if anything.” <em>That… was all she could really say in this case.</em> “If these gems are all just artificial, I would most certainly be upset. Though, if these are a newly discovered mineral, I would certainly be interested in what characteristics they would be classified under. Learning that would satisfy my curiosity, that is something I can guarantee.” <em>She responded.</em></span></div></div></div></div></div><div class=chatlog__message-group><div class=chatlog__author-avatar-container><img class=chatlog__author-avatar src=934644333028720731.html_Files/339bfab704f02e37cadac7f9af242159-BC3FD.png alt=Avatar loading=lazy></div><div class=chatlog__messages><span class=chatlog__author-name title="&#128150; Shade &#128150;#7384" data-user-id=478930314253565972 style=color:#b11717>Shade’s A Dargon</span> <span class=chatlog__timestamp>2022-01-24 05:16:57Z</span><div class=chatlog__message data-message-id=935040458005020722 id=message-935040458005020722 title="Message sent: 2022-01-24 05:16:57Z"><div class=chatlog__content><div class=markdown><span class=preserve-whitespace>( <span class=mention title=PandaPrince#0321>@bastard</span></span></div></div></div></div></div><div class=chatlog__message-group><div class=chatlog__author-avatar-container><img class=chatlog__author-avatar src=934644333028720731.html_Files/3ea6f348a466cead0c10c04ceb7dbfdc-7160B.png alt=Avatar loading=lazy></div><div class=chatlog__messages><span class=chatlog__author-name title="Akuza Caleshi#0000" data-user-id=922298917775900743>Akuza Caleshi</span> <span class=chatlog__bot-tag>BOT</span> <span class=chatlog__timestamp>2022-01-24 05:38:43Z</span><div class=chatlog__message data-message-id=935045935917064302 id=message-935045935917064302 title="Message sent: 2022-01-24 05:38:43Z"><div class=chatlog__content><div class=markdown><span class=preserve-whitespace>&quot;I can certainly see how it&#39;d be lonely.

She took a moment to think of what to exactly say.</em> “If you ever do wish to just talk about those concerns, I may be a bit doubtful but…” <em>She paused for a moment.</em> “I’d be willing to listen.” <em>She offered. She sounded genuine in this small moment of time. In a way, it looped back to her original promise to him in an odd way. However, there were no longer the intentions of simply conversing for more information. It was funny how she had changed in that way. Plus, it was nice to have a bit of company to talk to.</em> <em>…so maybe her wording was poor with mentioning how there may be an end. She noticed the reaction and change in tone, and it was at that moment she realized she messed up. A bit of a yikes on Erina’s half. Maybe it was best to let that conversation end there.</em> <em>There was a bit of a silence from Akuza as he tried to piece together her question. It would’ve been infinitely more awkward to outright say “hey, your eyes are glowing.” Although, after hearing the hesitance in Akuza’s response, she stopped for a moment. He seemed just as confused as she was, which was a bit shocking.</em> “Y…Yes?” <em>She hesitated to respond, really not wanting to make too much of a reaction.</em> “Were you not aware of that before?” <em>She asked, sounding just a tad concerned.</em></span></div></div></div></div></div><div class=chatlog__message-group><div class=chatlog__author-avatar-container><img class=chatlog__author-avatar src=934644333028720731.html_Files/339bfab704f02e37cadac7f9af242159-BC3FD.png alt=Avatar loading=lazy></div><div class=chatlog__messages><span class=chatlog__author-name title="&#128150; Shade &#128150;#7384" data-user-id=478930314253565972 style=color:#b11717>Shade’s A Dargon</span> <span class=chatlog__timestamp>2022-01-25 04:59:06Z</span><div class=chatlog__message data-message-id=935398353867530240 id=message-935398353867530240 title="Message sent: 2022-01-25 04:59:06Z"><div class=chatlog__content><div class=markdown><span class=preserve-whitespace>( <span class=mention title=PandaPrince#0321>@bastard</span></span></div></div></div></div></div><div class=chatlog__message-group><div class=chatlog__author-avatar-container><img class=chatlog__author-avatar src=934644333028720731.html_Files/3ea6f348a466cead0c10c04ceb7dbfdc-7160B.png alt=Avatar loading=lazy></div><div class=chatlog__messages><span class=chatlog__author-name title="Akuza Caleshi#0000" data-user-id=922298917775900743>Akuza Caleshi</span> <span class=chatlog__bot-tag>BOT</span> <span class=chatlog__timestamp>2022-01-25 05:50:05Z</span><div class=chatlog__message data-message-id=935411186088935445 id=message-935411186088935445 title="Message sent: 2022-01-25 05:50:05Z"><div class=chatlog__content><div class=markdown><span class=preserve-whitespace><img loading=lazy class=emoji alt=surprise title=surprise src=https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/812047593889726495.png> <em>He wasn&#39;t expecting the offer of a leisurely conversation.

If anyone were to ask Erina to partake in a casual talk before this killing game, she would’ve declined. But Erina had changed since then, even though it was a short amount of time. So while some things may never change, it was apparent the geologist had learned something in some way shape or form. She listened to Akuza accept the offer, and that came as a bit of a surprise to the geologist. Odd. However, it was also relieving that he ended up accepting the offer.

He was simply approaching the war house at that time, and it was pretty early on when the game started. So she couldn’t really hold that against him for keeping his mask on. Though, something Akuza said had brought the geologist back for a brief moment of time. Being down in the crystalline caverns with no way to contact the others, she often forgets that her ghostly existence was a bit of an unknown topic. And just the simple mention that Akuza came down with the idea no one else was here reminded her of the reality of this situation. The rest of that discussion sort of faded out to her as she was stuck on that fact. She peered over by the pool and looked at her reflection. Ghosts have a reflection, right? Well, her demeanor changed slightly as the topic shifted.</em> “…I keep forgetting that you guys don’t know I’m here.” <em>She started, although it seemed pretty jarring how it was seemingly out of nowhere. However, sometimes a certain word can trigger the bridging of odd topics.</em> “It seems most people have come down here with the intention of being alone for a moment. I did the same. Now, though, I’m always down here, and I suppose I am interrupting the time you wanted to spend alone. I should apologize for that.” <em>She stated. She sounded a bit… defeated, as she continued still just looking at the pool.</em> <em>She noticed Akuza also adjusted his goggles. Well, unexpected, but it wasn’t worth pointing out. She’d be quite the hypocrite otherwise. She listened to him speak about the last time he visited. Seemed like the glowing had no importance then. She nodded after he finished.</em> “I suppose you would’ve been questioned earlier. Still a bit strange though to figure out now of all times.
