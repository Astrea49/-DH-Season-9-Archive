After the events of the dryad crashing into the house, in which the results of said attack are probably still there, she came to the conclusion it was better to keep on guard. It wasn’t like she had much to lose in this case, anyways. The most she would be losing was talking to others which, in her eyes, was never really a bad thing. Loneliness always has its pros and cons, after all. It can help establish independence, decisions are made easier, and hobbies and work become more of a priority because one wouldn’t have to rearrange their schedule for the reason of wanting to hang out with friends. However, loneliness always comes with a heavy toll. The toll of perhaps learning new ideas, the idea of talking to others about casual topics like the weather or new daily events, and the mere basic concept of friends.</em></span>

In the situation the dryad would return from the shadowy depths of the forest, she would surely be killed on the spot. She had no way of defense on hand and, funny enough, no fighting skills of her own. It was odd how someone so pathetically weak made it into a house whose very concept surrounded violence. But, here she was in the war ridden house. She pulled out the seashell the medic gave to her and looked at it for a moment. She was still unsure of why he gave her the shell, but she has the shell. She continued looking at it, examining the colors, shape, everything, before returning it to her pocket once more. It had been a little while since she had left the tower, and not much had happened. She was hesitant on leaving, just with the internalized fear something, or someone, would be heading towards the war house once again. That possibility had to reside in her head at all times after the secret door situation. However, after a bit of waiting and deciding, she decided maybe it was best to head down from the watchtower.</em></span>

She sat down in one of the many chairs in the house, like she had time and time again. She quickly realized that she did not know much about her roommates, and vice versa. Perhaps it was for the better, since information such as that could easily be used against her. The very concept of having something she said or did used against was not something she enjoyed thinking about. Once again, it was simply another page in the book of wandering alone. People one has seen are people, and nothing more than that. Strangers you happen to pass while walking down the road on a busy day, only to occasionally see in the future. If you even meet them again, that is. She looked over at the crown with the now mysterious jewel of the war house placed in it. As much as she wanted to pick it up and look at it, she just didn’t want her roommates to view it as odd or suspicious. In reality, she had no desire to wear the crown. The crown was about as important to her as another artifact, stone, or record she had to look at. It would be important, but not to a point of a main priority. The stone within the crown, however, had piqued her interest. She was a geologist, after all. A simple stone like that was something she wanted to learn about, something she wished to see up close and examine. It would only benefit her, after all, she would think to herself. But now is not the time to think of that sort of thing. Perhaps in the future she will examine the stone in the crown, if she can convince her roommates to at least let her look at it, but not now.</em>

It is only natural to learn about the living situation and the resources the other have. With slow and steady but powerful steps, it was obvious he was a man on a mission, with peace of mind and a singular goal in mind for now. Looking over to the war building... he rued actually having to go there, it is not the type of building he really enjoyed... he blood was giving bad vibes and all of the coats didnt exactly add to him liking the place, it seemed so very against everything he believed in. It is not only that, the scortched lands around the place made him seem so out of place walking around there, a person with such a love for the light is walking a path of destruction right now... his mind was refusing to take more steps thinking about the place as a place going against all of his values. But Lucian had no other choice, his logic overruling his desire to go back to the light he knows so well, the hall filled with incense that made him feel so at home. The stained glass making way to the room with the peaceful glow... it honestly reminded him of home, the bright corridors and the churches nearby where he would pray for everyones well being and think about the things that happened on his own. Usually when he walked out of that room he would meet a person with emerald eyes already waiting for him, but he didnt have that crutch right now either. He is isolated, forced to be strong for everyone like he was taught to, while it isnt exactly what he liked doing he was a dutybound person who will do whatever is required to aid everyone even if it did make him uncomfortable.</em>

<em>Finally arriving at the doorstep of the dormitory he would knock on it, it was a knock with purpose although there was no aggression felt behind it. Lucian merely wanted to see who else is there so he can maybe connect with another person who may or may not need his help. Helping others is all he has right now</em></span>

It was not like the building appeared the most welcoming either, from the rough exterior to the very fact it looked as if a battle was already happening. It was rough, it would most likely be terrifying to look at, and most of all, it definitely benefited in keeping others away. Or, for the most part it did. Despite the war-like appearance, that was one benefit Erina did not mind about the house. It wasn’t ideal to live in a place like this, but it did help with not having too many people visiting all the time. If the house of war looked to be more friendly, not only would it not be appropriately named, it would cause people to want to investigate the place more. It would in turn have to result in questions being asked of the place. She wouldn’t have been able to answer those questions, since she in turn did not know all the answers. She could try her best, but her best wouldn’t have to be enough. Her best was never good enough.</em></span>

She then glanced over at the fireplace once again. To the others, it was probably odd she constantly kept an eye on the fireplace, but she had her reasons, of course. She continued to think about the events of what had happened in the recent past. The unexpected visit, the mysterious room, all of it. She let her mind wander for a bit, until the sudden knocking at the door snapped her out of it. She waited for a moment to see if anyone would get the door before her, but it seemed like that was not the case. It was not the case last time, and it would appear it was not the case this time. She got up from the chair and adjusted her glasses. Then, she adjusted her coat before walking towards the door. Perhaps someone had invited a friend, if anyone in this game even had any friends yet, or perhaps it was someone who swallowed any fear they had and approached the door.</em>

<em>She opened the door and… well, this is definitely someone new. At least, new to the geologist. She stood with fairly good posture, to hopefully keep a sense of formality. She was an ultimate, after all. Ultimates had to live up to their titles. From what she could quickly tell, this was not someone one would expect to walk up to the house of war so seemingly effortlessly. But, sometimes there’s more to the story than what can be seen at surface level. She greeted the other in a formal fashion, although the sight of the geologist was probably not the first expectation compared to what the rest of the house looked like exterior wise. At least opening the door had helped with her greeting skills.</em>

“Greetings. Welcome to the House of War.” <em>She started.</em></span>

It isnt the best information but at times one would have to make do with what they have right now. There isnt much more to be done anyways, well besides slowly knocking on the door as he is thinking back to the time he went into his own dorm, it was like it was made for him. A bright place with incense. Lucian has the faint smell of the incense eminating from him, a surefire way to tell which house he belonged to after all.</em>

<em>It was relatively quiet in his dorm, so he didnt expect many things to go on here... and with relatively quiet he meant there was a salesman who argues with a kid. An overzealous magician, a model who is genuinely a nice person even if she is a little very direct in her questions and a man he hadnt talked to yet, but he seemed calm so Lucian assumed his mental health was in proper condition or at least that he wasnt a problem for now</em>

<em>Hearing someone approach the door Lucian didnt exactly do anything special, he had been trained in posture and proper behavior for as long as he can think, standing there with his well kept blonde, almost golden hair, the porcellain complexion that even in the crude lighting of the war house has not a single imperfection. The only thing he did do as he was about to meet a new person was gently tug on the ends of the tie slip, to make sure it is in a proper position to display the blue gemstone, as Erina would guess a sapphire. An actually rather big sapphire at that. Lucian was always told, from birth onward that first impressions are the most important thing when meeting someone new, stand too proudly and they assume you are prideful and will be hostile.</em></span>

There are multiple things that make a person, more than just their birth or looks, ironic coming from someone who got lucky in both of those things, but he wasnt about to yield to those traditional power standarts-</em>

<em>Finally the door opend and Lucian saw a person he could recall from the monopad, the glasses, the coat, the hairstyle and color. It was Erina Normandy, the ultimate geologist, a person who actually could teach him a lot he needed to know to form a proper plan here, he didnt expect her in a place like this but he would make do, meeting her greeting with one of his own</em>

On one hand, she was going to be living with the others in the dorm for quite some time. However, a counteract towards that is the fact that it is an information game. The game where anything you can and any action you make can easily be twisted and deceived. A game where those you trust could easily pull the knife of betrayal and stab you in the back. It was a game within this game, where trust runs scarce and friendships may be harder to withhold. Although Erina was interested in that sort in the first place. Her knowledge of the others in the dorm were scarce, not even a name could stick in her head. Her knowledge of those outside of the dorms were even more rare, having only a handful of loose connections to those in other dorms. They might be loose connections, but they still benefited in her own masquerade game: the idea of asking Questions and finding Answers. Whether they would come to her with questions or vice versa, in her eyes she was making progress. Progress with her questions answered. Questioning simple things such as the gem now in the crown helped her keep a level head in such a vast unknown game.

Perfect posture, tidy clothing, or about as tidy as you can get out in the jungle, it seemed the new stranger was definitely one who deserved to have the utmost respect. Erina treated every conversation with the same tone: calm, formal, with a dash of curiosity. She quickly took notice of the rather sapphire, which was easy to tell. Not many gems possessed such a rich, natural blue hue. While some gems, such as Azurite or Lapis, could withhold such a strong shade of blue, they often had any other colors sprinkled in, and were never as rich of a shade of blue. Not even the gem in her own necklace, a piece of Lapis Lazuli, had the same richness in color as the sapphire. She listened to the other introduce himself in a more formal manner. It seemed that one thing they appeared to have in common: a formal tone when greeting someone. Perhaps this formality will fade with time as they continue to talk, or perhaps it will remain as formal as can be. Although the mention of “finally able to meet you” would quickly catch the geologist off guard, for it implies he knew of her beforehand. But Erina had not given much time to look over the names along the monopad, and often thought everyone would’ve been in a similar fashion.</em>

“It is a pleasure to meet you as well, Lucian. My name is Erina Normandy, Ultimate Geologist. If you would like to come in, then you may do so.” <em>She offered. It would have been impolite of her to not offer, after all.</em>

<em>It had appeared on the surface level someone was beginning to become used to the very concept of being the unofficial House of War welcomer.</em></span>

                            <span class="preserve-whitespace"><em>Unfortunately, while Lucian really isnt too keen on playing games with others there seems to be no other way than to do it, forcing oneself to behave in a way that adjusts to other peoples desires was always something rather sad to him, he would much rather accept and talk to a person the way they are. So he would pick the risky option, to play with an open hand. It might put others on edge with the honesty and is by far not the safest option to take but that is a relatively small price to pay to try and make them comfortable, that would potentially make them calmer and less willing to participate and maybe he could even get to their problems and attempt to aid, as difficult as that may be in a place where everyone could stab your back at every turn.</em>

<em>But again, there was no need to play a game everyone else is playing. Adjusting to their strategy isnt a move Lucian would use in this social chess. He had no interest in taking any pieces from someone as long as they arent doing something super rude to another, yet he also didnt plan to just let himself be taken, surrendering to him would be the worst thing he could do. Giving up would, after all imply that he gave his values away, surrendering himself to the fate of this island, which he had not the least bit of interest in doing.</em>

&quot;Of course I would like to, it is a lot nicer to talk inside after all&quot; <em>In all honestly, he disliked the place and walking in there required a bit of convincing himself, but he was rather sure that this was a safe enough situation. After all there dont seem to be many people who have access to the dorms, so killing someone there would be the worst decision, unless you are planning on framing someone else.</em>

<em>So he quickly walks past Erina and into the dorm, the faint scent of Incense can be smelt as he passes by, an aftereffect of Lucian being in the creation dorm, a side effect he was rather fond of to be honest. It was a calming and familiar smell, at least to him</em></span>

Whether it’s subtle gestures, the tone of their voice, or even something simple as eye contact, there is always much to discover in that sense. Erina always kept a straight posture, a formal tone, and remembered to always keep eye contact. It helped her show her own sense of authority and formality, and showed others that they should treat her with respect. Or at least, that was her goal in this game of social chess.</em>

<em>The war dorm would most definitely be a contrast to the other dorms. It was rougher, unwelcoming, and in a way not for the faint of heart. From the barricades alongside the dorm’s exterior to the several watchtowers, to the scorched earth below, it definitely stood out compared to the other dorms. Initially, Erina despised the war dorm. It was unkempt, unfamiliar, and definitely intimidating at a first glance. However, people adapt, and Erina grew to tolerate the war dorm to a certain extent. Perhaps it was because it had basically become her new home. Although, the lack of knowledge regarding her fellow roommates did make the situation worrying on her end. But, that was hopefully going to be resolved with time. If the other roommates would wish to speak to her, that is.</em>

<em>She invited Lucian inside the war dorm, and realized she was playing a similar game of inviting people into the dorm for the sake of “being polite”. She had invited Lucian into the dorm, and quickly took note of the faint scent of incense from the creation dorm. That was clearly enough to tell Erina he did not reside in the nature dorm. So, she decided to mention that in whatever conversation would strike. But perhaps in a little while that question will pop into the conversation.</em></span>

On one hand, this could be an elaborate scheme. On the other hand, however, if she took the risk, she could perhaps gain valuable information regarding the current scenario. Maybe she is internally paranoid. Maybe she is just playing it safe. She ran all the options, and the pros and the cons of each, in her head for a little while. The idea of a joint meal to socialize and exchange information… in a killing game, it felt too good to be true in her eyes.

That being direct lessons or the passive insight you gain over people after a while. There was something off about the way Erina behaved, it is like she had to actually put effort into the interaction which Lucian did pick on rather quickly, to him a talk should be something effortless, to him there was no need to keep posture, have a steady calm voice or even eye contact in mind, it was supposed to be the natural state of someone, although he cant fault a scientist for difficulties in this, social interaction wasnt their main selling point after all. To him it was a well trained process that had no room for mistakes, although he does commend Erina for trying to show respect, if it werent rude to do so he would give her pointers, but for now there is only a slight curl of his lips upwards, his semi stern expression softening up as he gets his first impressions, &#180;not bad&#180; he thinks.</em>

<em>It sure isnt welcoming, although Lucian had put his grievances with it behind. He wouldnt want to live here but it wasnt the worst place there is. Well maybe out of the dorms it is the one he enjoys the least but there is no need to stay there for extended periods of time, he isnt exactly a fan of the scortched earth. It looks so violent and Lucian despises war for multiple reasons, mainly because it takes so many lives.. under those the people he swore to protect as he couldnt just go and join a war, the job he was delegated was calming the public and maybe doing tactics. But fortunately he never witnessed war in his lifetime and he would try to keep it that way. Anything can be solved non violent after all, violence is a sign that you are at your wits end and Lucian had too much education to arrive at his wits end for such a simple thing, he would not cry tears of loss for his heralds if at all avoidable.</em></span>

<em>It is not that Lucian isnt one for smalltalk, just that he expected Erina, as a scientist, to not have any interest in going about small matters. It suits his intentions as well, it makes everything quicker, that way he had more time for his regular check ups on the places and especially the amount of things they still had there, he kept close track of everything that could be used as weaponary, a safety precaution Lucian admits is only of little use, as he had no idea to know who took the things if they were taken and if someone had taken things there would be no way to investigate it or for them to admit it if they planned to use it for something bad, yet it still gives him an overview about how much is circling around. Good information to have nonetheless.</em>

<em>To Lucian his plan of eating together is without many faults, it would provide the safety of the whole group watching, the ability to get an estimate of the social scenarios and how the relationships are playing out and more than that their emotional state and how they are coping. There are always little signs of stress and in the worst case he could warn others about his findings in the hope that he would maybe get at least a little bit of public safety, as high as that goal is</em></span>

No one would collaborate to work together on a murder plan if there is no incentive, only one person can escape that way anyways and I highly doubt the bear would let us all get poisoned at once, not after he set up everything like that. My assumption is that he wants us to eliminate another one by one, slowly but surely reducing our numbers.&quot;

<em>Lucian spoke in a rather matter of face tone, although there was a tidbit of kindness sprinkled in, he does understand the dangers are something that would come to mind if he hadnt taken precautions,  but taking precautions is his job in the end, so he was sure about his decision. He ran countless scenes in his head but all of them ended well only for the people who cooperate, he isnt interested in a zero-sum situation, he wants to win something, that being public well being.</em>

<em>He also looked at Erina talk, the fact that she adjusted her glasses could just be a little personal tic but it was notable, in terms of what she said. Well the things she did say seemed to be sensible but he could feel her not being comfortable with words, she repeated the same words a few times and it did not seem to serve any argumentative purpose, which left him to assume it was just her stumbling in the conversation, not that he minded but it was a sign of nervousness or at least that she wasnt used to conversations like that, although up to now he wasnt sure on how to make it any more comfortable to her, electing to just keep going for now</em></span>

They are able to withhold good social skills. For others, however, it can cause a great deal of stress. Perhaps it’s because of lack of social interaction from a young age, or perhaps with time one simply wishes to no longer have a conversation. Erina would fall into the latter of two options, just not being one for social interaction. There would be reasons for this, of course, for there has to be a reason for everything. It could simply be because she is a scientist. She is one who often finds herself working alone, and her intelligence in her field is more of a priority than whether or not she wishes to have small talk. Some people would prefer to have moments of small talk with others. It may even be more beneficial than harmful in the killing game. However, Erina is someone who holds strict standards for herself, and small talk is just one of the few things that she did not see as important.</em>

<em>The inside of the dorm was more welcoming than the outside, although even then that would not be saying much. It still seemed violent and unkempt, as if it was ever preparing for the wars of despair. However, the dorm itself was also heavily guarded. Or, it would appear to be that way. She herself could be seen as more of a guarded person, while also constantly on the lookout for information. She is more kept to herself rather than going around getting to know everyone. She tries to play things safe, although in the end that really becomes difficult in the killing game. Erina, despite the unfamiliarity of the killing game, tries to gather information because in a more unknown place such as this killing game, such as this jungle, knowledge truly can become power by the end of it.</em></span>

It would’ve made no sense to try and poison everyone, for the bear probably had his own plans for eliminating the group. The idea that the numbers would just slowly decrease rather than all at once seemed like something that Monokuma would do. That is something she realized the two could agree on. Although there was still a reason to be skeptical, it seemed she could at least be somewhat safe. The only thing that was holding herself back from declining, for the most part, was the potential exchange of information so far. It always looped back to information for Erina. She had several questions and no answers, so if the others may have information, she can use that to benefit herself. It was much like her studies, after all, although her studies are not as “life or death” as this. Using the information she knew, along with that of which others had given her, in order to figure out what she didn’t know. She had her own questions, along with probably everyone else stranded in the jungle, so she would look for answers. She thought over Lucian’s offer again. It was easy to tell she was thinking over it again and again and again. Flipping through both sides of the going and not going. It was such a simple matter, and yet, here was Erina, taking forever to answer the question. After a bit of thinking, she finally gave him a very simple answer.</em>

“I have decided. I will be joining you for this event. It would seem unlikely that the bear will wish to eliminate us all at once, like you have said.” <em>She said, although in her tone it hinted at a slightest of hesitance.</em></span>

Or, perhaps he was being genuine and wanted to get everyone together to escape the game for a brief moment in time. In her eyes, this “event” left her a bit uneasy. But what else did she have to do otherwise? Wander the area of the jungle, looking for a chance of stumbling upon some new information? She lived a life of routine and organization before the game. She always played the safe route, but eventually there comes a time where a risk must be made. Going to this event might as well be the first risk she takes in this killing game. One of inevitably many. If things did okay out in her favor, and what Lucian said was him being genuine, this could greatly benefit her. Although after accepting Lucian’s request, she let out a long sigh and closed her eyes for a brief moment in time.

So he would never ever let anyone down that way. Walking around the scariest places with a smile on his face as he talks about any topic that is required of him to talk about, from casual topics to business deals or potential laws. There is no topic he feels visibly uncomfortable about. A quality that is highly benefitial in a social game such as this, he would never be seen as a weak link as showing weakness is unacceptable, in addition to him not having that many weaknesses anyways.</em>

<em>Slightly defended? Lucian didnt plan to invade so nothing really intimidated him, he was as calm as can be, there is no way anyone would take a target that risky upon himself and Lucian wouldnt be a target of a murder in this building. He is the type of person to neatly log all of the places he goes to before actually going, that way, if he ever doesnt get back his murder would be easy to solve, as there is a proper timeline from the start. He isnt planning for himself only, he is planning for all the people determined to survive by non violent means. There is nothing he would enjoy more than that... everyone getting out together, he took the first few steps in trying to get to know everyone even if it was more than a little stressful and not all interactions went as well as he would have liked them to go, but that isnt a big problem, he had time after all. And he would use all the time he had to prepare himself mentally for the time where something does go off course, for he cannot allow himself to break under pressure.

It didnt make sense to him if that were to happen.</em>

<em>Again, a game of information and intrigue was a thing Lucian was all to familiar with, gaining and spreading information was something high society prepares you quite well for, it is a social minefield, any minor misstep could offend someone and lead to rivalries that have lasting consequences, the fact that his own life is on the line wasnt even that scary to him. For Lucian it would rather be his life than his citizens lives, so there isnt even the most at stake for him, they were, honestly, a lot more important to him than his own well being.</em>

<em>So looking over to Erina questioning his motives and potentially his ways of going about things was something he never really experienced that openly... no one usually dares asking questions quite as openly or even look that questioning openly, although he did understand she was not one for this type of interaction, so when she finally did come to a conclusion Lucian merely smiled</em>

&quot;It is set then, I will have you for the joint meal, please do use the occasion to properly introduce yourself to the others, after all, a semblance of knowledge about the other is the first step towards trust and trust is the thing keeping the most of us from making selfish decisions. Alongside morals of course, but I doubt you are interested in a philosophical debate&quot;

<em>Again, Erinas posture was quite easily readable, crossed arms are a sign of being closed off to an idea after all, this in and of itself made him quite worried as he is, by heart, a really worrying person. Putting others well being above his own</em></span>

But it was, after all, the most efficent way to bring people together, everyone just randomly meeting was not something that just happens, yet it had to happen so everyone could speak their mind and add something to the big topic of escape.</em>

<em>Seeing Erina this hesitant he offers a gentle smile as he looks at her, the ocean blue eyes staring at Erinas soul for just a second as the rosy lips, curled up give a nice contrast to the porecellain skin he bears. Last but not least the golden shine from the hair, very reminiscent of actual gold and the golden locks angels have in all the christian paintings give Lucian the look one would expect from a kindly saint, the gentle aura, everything. He wasnt menacing, yet he demanded a bit of respect. He wasnt doing anything, yet he seemed serene and on a mission. A shining example of what Lucians teachers had seen as a proper, leader. Someone kind, who isnt afraid of taking matters into his own hands, eloquent even in the face of danger, unflinching as he nods once.</em>
 
&quot;This is by no means a binding agreement, if you dont feel comfortable there is no need to actually go to the meal. I wouldnt want anyone to force themselves to do things they dislike, although, speaking from personal experience I can tell, at times it is smart to try out new things. You might like it and even if you dont particularly enjoy it you can be proud of yourself for trying something new. Not everyone has the disposition to do that.&quot;</span>

Each individual was weak in one way or another. Some places allow weakness to be slowly alluded to, or, in other cases, blow all weakness wide open like a gateway. Erina had always lived her life in a routine. Every day and every night she would perform around the same schedule, unless someone would pull her out of her normal schedule. Once she gets pulled out, once that routine gets removed, there is when all her weakness shows. “Don’t let anyone know your weaknesses. Knowing another’s weakness is dangerous.” While Lucian was also one who tended to speak to others, who tried to meet every person, Erina saw that as a weakness. She often kept to herself, even in the game she had not spoken to anyone on her terms, they had come to her. To her, solitude was a strength. To Erina, being alone is what kept her succeeding in her eyes. What kept from becoming a failure, what kept her from being weak in her eyes, what kept her from determined to try as hard as she humanly can.</em></span>

Being in an unfamiliar area, let alone stuck in a killing game, had changed a bit of her thinking. Much like in the scientific field, she was grasping at answers to solve her questions. Solve questions to at least find a small routine. That could potentially make her more of a target within the future, if knowledge did become more powerful with time in the game, but no one could predict that. But for now, the geologist was merely collecting information about the jungle for the sole reason of self satisfaction.</em>

<em>Lucian mentioned she at least briefly introduced herself to the others while at the group meal, and she nodded. She was planning on doing that anyway, since even she knew it was only proper to introduce herself. Although, she would not be surprised herself if some of the others had recognized at least her name. If Lucian knew of her beforehand, which could be proven by how he seemed to look for her to invite her, then others might have to. Plus, with the fact she was the ultimate geologist, perhaps someone might have recognized her from the science field.</em>

“I was already planning on giving a brief introduction to this meeting. It is only polite, after all.” <em>She responded.</em>

<em>Seeing Lucian’s attempts to ease the debate, Erina… really didn’t seem phased on the surface. She still remained with her professional posture, arms crossed, expression remaining calm, although with the slightest hint of hesitance. It seemed when it would come to her overall demeanor, she was completely unmoving in that sense, much like a statue. A statue which simply waits in the background, watching as the everyday life passes by. Although after Lucian mentioned she didn’t have to go, she furrowed her eyebrows. It was not the fact he mentioned it was not necessary she had to come, which had secretly relieved her quite a bit, it was what was said after.

Perhaps it was because she often tries to be a leader for herself. While she does listen to instructions from others in her work, she is one who tries to make decisions on her own. She is one who tries to not let others into her head, and that statement just happened to be one that slipped through. Or, it could’ve been because of the fact she had become comfortable in a sort of way regarding the way she had lived before the game. The way of living in the safety and comfort of what she knew. The comfort of not breaking those social barriers, and remaining in that isolation. It could’ve simply come across as being told to break her comfort zone even if she did not want to. Erina felt herself feeling a bit annoyed with that simple statement. She uncrossed her arms, and took a deep breath, washing away and pushing back that slight annoyance.</em>

“I will be attending the meal. I have my personal reasons for attending, on top of the fact I have already made my agreement to go.” <em>She commented, although there was a bitter tone creeping in through that response. Almost as if she was challenging Lucian with the statement of not going… or she was subconsciously challenging herself. Regardless, she quickly took notice of the subtle tone and quickly corrected herself.</em>

“Apologies. Like I have stated though, I will be attending the meal.”</span>

In his mind he doesnt need any protection right now, he has grown up in the treacherous field of politics and high society. Where showing any field that could be attacked would for sure be attacked and where not socialising is punished even harder than making mistakes. So there is no way in hell he was ever going to stop talking to everyone. He knew that even if you survive on your own, you still need others to cooperate to not get anyone killed, one murder will start a wave of murders.... as someone has taken the first step, caused panic and sort of taken the moral fall already... things are a lot easier to step over if one isnt the first he learned that in sociology.</em>

<em>While Lucian isnt unfamiliar with science his expertise sure isnt on a level that Erinas is, he never had to do serious research, he knows the process for the few things he did have to write but there was never a desperate grasp for answer or questioning something until the solution arrived. Politics dont give you that much time, you need to act fast and be decisive, if you arent someone will step over you and Lucian isnt the type of person who will surrender like this, giving up is a show of weakness. The more the bear pushes them all towards something the more he wants to resist, giving up was never an option, it wasnt from birth forward, giving up..... is nothing a ruler can do. If a ruler gives up he already forfeit his will, and that will reflect on the citizens... the people around him, everyone. Giving up will send messages that must not be sent at all cost</em>

<em>Personal research is the barebone of any interaction, be that cold or hot reads about a person. Although Lucian did read into Erinas manners and way of talking the most basic information was provided by the monopad</em></span>

<em>Good to know Erina already planned an introduction... it is a rather convenient time for those after all, multiple people at once, if Lucian is correct and she doesnt like social interactions that much, as she believes in ones own strength then this would for sure be the smarter option all things considered</em>

&quot;Good to hear, it will save you a lot of time in the long run. That way you will not have to go around and introduce yourself to everyone one at a time. I did that already&quot;

<em>Crossed arms you say? That is the guesture for being closed off from a conversation, while Lucian didnt exactly have the means to make her open up or the need really he still thinks being kind is better than nothing, as by heart he really just wants to get along with everyone no matter how people are going to see him. Be that naive, gullable or just stupid for not recognizing the gravity of the situation, but that is exactly why he has to do it, to make sure nothing bad ever happens. It takes but a crack in a person to make the whole facade drop, to have the walls fall down and some people cant deal with life without their defense mechanisms. Thats is why he is smiling, there is no need to be on guard around him, he never in his life wanted anyone any harm, not is he planning on starting that now.</em>

<em>It is true, when you wait for a leader to arrive you dont get anything done, Lucian subscribes to this school of thought too. Well he was raised to take the role head on anyways so there wasnt much he would do besides take it. He could refuse and not do it, but.... he doesnt mind, he wants to be a pillar for people, a safety net so they can feel like they are in good hands. Their well being is his in a way.</em></span>

Erina probably really doesnt have many social interactions in her day to day basis. Or so he assumes, giving nothing but a gentle nod to her reply</em>

&quot;That is good to hear, whatever your reasons may be you are wholly invited to come as long as you dont have any sinister intentions, which I dont take you as the person to have those. I went through many lengths to ensure the safety of the meeting after all, so even if someone does fear not. I have everything under control.&quot;

<em>A challenge it might be, but to be fair, one doesnt react to challenges like that. It can only end in one party having to yield, and while that shows that you have control it also puts a grude on you and with that a target on your back. One of the many lessons of high society, never strike directly for you dont know who might watch and deem you an enemy.... Lucian is not even doing a lot of thinking right now, those are all things that are engrained so deeply in him that is is second nature by now. Picking up on subtleties and peacefully shutting down challenges was a strength that was required to have.</em>

&quot;No need, there was no offence taken from my side, I apologise if I seem to pushy about the meal, it is a desire of mine to all get along. On the note of getting along, I will give you a small token of mine, I got one for everyone so there is no need to feel confused by it. You are all my dear classmates after all.&quot;

<em>And so out of his pocket he pulls a small gollden brooch, with an introcate Feather design and puts it on the table, as I assume they are talking while sitting and not doing all of this while standing.</em></span>
