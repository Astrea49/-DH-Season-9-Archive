It was only natural after the events of what had happened. She would take some time, or at least for the rest of this day, to think. Think alone. Think away from everyone at the moment because after what had just happened, she needed the alone time. The house was not welcoming towards, as one can only expect within a house painted with the colors and motif of battle and war. To Erina, that was simply what she had walked back from: the bloody war of the trial room. She was not much help with the trial, as painful of a reality as that was, it was the reality she lived in. She knew only a handful of people within the group, and out of those few none were really blamed. Or, if they were, the blame left as quickly as it came, like a phantom within the night. On top of that, she knew nothing regarding the other houses, other locations, nothing. This whole time, she thought she had the advantage, she thought she had the knowledge, but in reality, she had nothing. Erina Normandy, Ultimate Geologist, had no information that could have been of any use. The group may have voted correctly and succeeded, but in her eyes, she did nothing but fail.</em></span></div></div></div><div class=chatlog__message data-message-id=922317409845673994 id=message-922317409845673994 title="Message sent: 2021-12-20 02:40:06Z"><div class=chatlog__content><div class=markdown><span class=preserve-whitespace><em>She scanned the room once more, eyes locking onto the fireplace. She could never openly tell anyone why she would always focus on fire. The torch when they first got shipwrecked. The campfire when Wynona had spoken to her. The fireplace within the house of war. The fireplace again. The fireplace again. The fireplace again. The bonfire in the trial, no matter where she went, how far she could run, no matter where she stayed, it followed her. Fire. Fire had always been at her heels since she had found herself shipwrecked. And she hated it. Fire was an uncontrollable force: one minute it flares up in anger, the next it settles down into a state of serenity. It was a contradiction in itself: representing protection and destruction, eternity and torment, and life and death itself. Fire was a force which was misunderstood within a variety of contexts. She continued staring at the fire, although from a distance. A slight shiver went up her spine as she watched the flames strike higher, only to sink down again. Up and down, up and down. To her, fire was an unpredictable force. Fire has a mind of its own, and is a force that is difficult to track on its own. Fire can be sporadic, or fire can be controlled. The properties and behavior of fire are always unknown, everchanging.</em> <em>And that was the very thing that scared her.</em> <em>After staring at fear in the eyes, she broke out of her state of mind, and wandered over to her bed in the house of war.

A state of uselessness she was in throughout, where all she could do was wait and hope for the best. She had no knowledge. The seeds she had planted within herself all those years had begun to grow. The seeds which start off small, showing to be useful. The plants which lead its victims into a state of security, simply saying “this is right, you want this.” The seeds which began to grow its thorny vibes around the geologist. The thorns which allowed her to tell herself simple things, “an ultimate has been the best at their title. It’s why they earned the title in the first place.”, “Ultimates have to devote their life to their talent, or what use is the title?”, and twisting the term of an “ultimate title.” to a way which fits her standards.

The shell was a round shape, showing a state of near perfection. She held the shell in hand for some time, running her finger along each groove and indent on it. Such a simple gift from the stranger she had met only once on the island: Akuza Caleshi, the ultimate medic. Their first meetup was unplanned on the geologist’s behalf, simply being at the right place at the right time. Although during that, the thought that she would have potentially been needed, her skills might’ve finally been useful in this state of chaos, well. That was enough for the geologist to enjoy the conversation the two had. Perhaps the main reason was because the conversation was about a topic she had sold her life to. Regardless, after the dryad attack some time ago, if they ever had the lucky chance to meet again, perhaps that information regarding the stone and the attack may be of use towards the medic. Although her trust with him was thin for the time being, there was still a bit of trust. Just… not easily shown.</em> <em>Setting aside the seashell for the time being, she looked over the second item which she was given: a brooch. It was a nice golden hue, a bit of cleanliness and order within the state of chaos she was in. Much like the person who had given it to her. Lucian D’Arc, the ultimate prince. From their first conversation, which also resulted in a “right place at the right time” scenario, he seemed to have good intentions. However, a cloud of skepticalness had followed him, or at least in her eyes it did. However, the cloud had let itself fade away as they spoke, although that did not mean it had entirely vanished. It had just let itself leave enough for the geologist to accept the invitation to the group meal. A deal which, if she had the offer towards her again, she would decide to politely decline. However, Lucian spoke simple words, which in her thoughts, translated as a challenge. “It is smart to try new things.”</em></span></div></div></div><div class=chatlog__message data-message-id=922317634500952094 id=message-922317634500952094 title="Message sent: 2021-12-20 02:40:59Z"><div class=chatlog__content><div class=markdown><span class=preserve-whitespace><em>She looked back over at the shell and brooch once again, as the same question lingered in her head. “Why?” Why did they give her these small items which, at a first glance may seem useless, had shifted her perspective in such a way. She held both the items once again, looking at them. The rough, natural appearance of the shell contrasted with the clean and manmade brooch. And yet, these two items were now in her possession. The contrast which reminded her of the other interactions she had since being shipwrecked. The outgoing Nephologist, Wynona, who had spoken to Erina about the cloud witch, and even now she still finds herself looking up at the clouds for this witch. Another was brief conversation with Sadao Matsumoto, the Ultimate Poet. The second time they had spoken, first being on the boat. It was pleasant to see a familiar face once again, although in the end how familiar is the stranger you’ve seen only once before? She thought about it again and again, until it hit her.</em> <em>Four interactions. But, in her eyes, four too many.</em> <em>She had finally felt the thorns which had been there for all this time dig into her. This feeling, these interactions… None of them were right. The murder of Corr, the Execution of Reiichi, two of which she had never met before, none of it was right. Nothing on this island was right. She should be at home, spending day and night researching, spending her time retaining her title of Ultimate Geologist. She shouldn’t be socializing, for it would only be a distraction to her.
